      <h2>1997-1991 - Birth and Early life</h2>
      <p>
        Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972
      </p>
      <p>
        Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but "a bit of a loner" who was often bullied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eminem heard his first rap song on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkinghorn.
      </p>
      <p>
        After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades, he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17.
      </p>
      <p>Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.

      <p>
        Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores
      </p>
      <p>
        Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite, and the feedback Eminem did receive ("Why don't you go into rock and roll?") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks
      </p>
      <p>
        After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt
      </p>
